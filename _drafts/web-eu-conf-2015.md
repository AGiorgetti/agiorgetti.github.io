The date is approaching (September 26, 2015) and I didn't yet made a blog post bragging about being one of the speaker at the [Web European Conference 2015](http://webnextconf.eu/) in Milan (Italy).
**Bad, very bad!**

It's time to tell the world!

Do You live in Europe (in Italy)?  You cannot miss this one! Look at the [Speakers](http://webnextconf.eu/#speakers), look at the [Agenda](http://webnextconf.eu/#schedule): a 4 tracks conference all focused on web development and related technologies.

I will have the priviledge to be part of this event as a speaker, and I'll talk about TypeScript (a relatively new player on the web development scene).

Wish me good luck and see You there!
