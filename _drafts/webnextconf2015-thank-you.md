I'm on my way back home and I'm writing these lines, dunno when in the next days I'll publish this post, not too late I hope.

I'm doing it right now to capture the moment and not let the feeling fade; it has been a great experience, I had the chance to meet some new very cool guys and see again some friends of old.

I had the chance to see a *animale da palcoscenico* like Scott Hansleman open up the conference with his keynote, and I learned a lot on how to *stay on stage*; it's definitely not an easy job if you wanna do it well.

It was also good to be back on a stage again after quite some time; I was a little scared at start, this was my first public talk in english after two+ years and I didn't knew how rusty I was with the language and if I could keep it up.

I 'survived'! And I'm feeeling good, I had a couple of *indecisioni*, but overral, way better than I tought it could have be gone!

I really have to say thank you to all the girls and guys involved in the organization of the event *aggiungi lista di nominativi e riferimenti twitter*, their dedication and passion made it possibile.

A special thank goes to my friend [Ugo Lattanzi](http://tostring.it), he did hammered me so much to be part of the conference that eventually I couldn't say no and I answered the call for papers just in time. Luckily one of my session passed the screening and was in!

So I 'rebooted' myself and here we are! I'm blogging again and I'll be out there taking part in more events, to meet new guys and have fun, exchanging knowledge and learning from the great professionals that spend their time sharing their experiences, most of the time **for free**.

Thanks to the Web European Conference for igning the flame again, see you next year! I'll be there once again (in a way or another)!
