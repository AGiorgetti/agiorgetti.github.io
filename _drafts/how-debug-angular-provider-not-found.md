Suppose you created a project with the Angular CLI and you built it in production mode with the flags: --prod --aot

When you launch the application there are chaces you get an error like: "Error: No provider for x!":

You are given no useful information here:

- 'n' is the minified name of the service that's causing the failure.
- the stacktrack is poiting to the minified bundles generated by webpack.

Debugging a "Error: No provider for x!" isn't easy, but there's a procedure you can follow to discover which service is giving you troubles.

The first thing to do is enable the sourcemap generation, so build your project with something like this:

    ng build --prod --aot --sourcemaps=true

Then, when you execute the application in the browser, you'll get a more meaningful stacktrace, pointing to your original source code files. You can place a breakpoint at the failing position.

You can now click on the file, set the breakpoint and run the application again. when you open the debugging tools again You'll see something similar to the following stacktrace (on the right side):

Walk back the stack until you reach the ReflectiveInjector's get() function, at this point you can inspect the 'token' parameter to know which service is giving you trouble:

Now you know how to discover which service is the source of your problems!
