Last week I had the honor and the priviledge to give speech at the italian [AngularConf 2015](http://2015.angularconf.it/), which was held at the Environment Park in Turin (Italy). It was a very good event with many interesting sessions on Angular 1.x and a look some aspects of Angular 2.0.

I've hosted a session on which benefits you have when using TypeScript to develop Angular 1.x applications and how your code will change when you move to Angular 2.0.

Here are the slides I used as a reference:

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em">

</div>

The public repositories with the code samples are hosted on GitHub:

Angular 1.x: <https://github.com/AGiorgetti/AngularConf2015>

Angular 2.0: <https://github.com/AGiorgetti/AngularConf2015_ng2>

The full material of all the sessions will be available soon through the conference [website](http://2015.angularconf.it/).

Video records of the whole conference will be available at a later time courtesy of [HTML.it](http://www.html.it/).
