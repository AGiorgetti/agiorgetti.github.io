title: A Windows Live Essentials Suite Beta is out...how to workaround the ‘no internet
  connection’ setup problem
---

<p>A new version of the Windows Live Essential Suite was released on August the 17th, you can get it <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-beta">here</a> (at your own risk!); if you want to try it out you can have a very bad surprise:</p>  <p>after having chosen the applications you want to install, at the end of the setup the whole procedure might fail with a very informative ‘No internet connection’ error message.</p>  <p>You can have a look at the real problem looking at the Windows Live setup log (located in: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\WLSetup\Logs), which is usually a missing dependency or something similar.</p>  <p>In my case it seemed the installer was trying to download a language pack (Italian, in my case) which is not currently available and that caused the setup process to stop.</p>  <p>Switching all the locale information of my system to the ‘United States’ language didn’t solved the problem.</p>  <p>The trick to overcome this problem is simple:</p>  <p>- uninstall all your current Windows Live Essentials </p>  <p>- go to: “C:\Program Files\Common Files\Windows Live\.cache” and clean it up, this is the folder where the setup files will be downloaded</p>  <p>- run the setup again and when it fails hit ‘Cancel’</p>  <p>- go to the previous folder and rerun all the setup modules you find inside each sub-directory.</p>  <p>Everything should work now! (At least it did for my installation).</p>  <p>I’m still not able to log in MSN Messenger due the the nasty 80040154 error, it seems no-one is able to discover what’s causing it, but now I can use and test the new Live Writer again (and I’m happy with that).</p><h2>Related Content</h2><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/a-windows-live-essentials-suite-beta-is-out.hot-to-workaround-the-no-internet-connection-setup-problem">A Windows Live Essentials Suite Beta is out...hot to workaround the ‘no internet connection’ setup problem</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/dexter-dynamic-pages-windows-live-writer-support">Dexter is growing: Dynamic Pages and better Windows Live Writer support</a> (06/02/2010)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/build-windows-8">Build: Windows 8</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/winforms-improving-rendering-performances-backgroundimage-backgroundimagelayout">Winforms: improving rendering performances with BackgroundImage and BackgroundImageLayout</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/hp-proliant-microserver-windows-7-or-vista-installation-issues">HP ProLiant MicroServer, Windows 7 or Vista installation issues</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="/Blog/Related/a-windows-live-essentials-suite-beta-is-out-hot-to-workaround-the-no-internet-connection-setup-problem"><strong>More related document (6)</strong></a></li></ul><br />
