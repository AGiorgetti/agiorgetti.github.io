title: The NHibernate Day is coming...this Saturday!
---

<p>If you’re a fan of NHibernate, if you use it for your everyday work or just if you are curious about it, you should have not missed to register for the first European <a href="http://www.nhday.eu/en.aspx" target="_blank">NH Day</a> coming up this Saturday.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.nhday.eu/en/agenda.aspx" target="_blank">Agenda</a> is quite rich, various and with very interesting topics...it promises to be a very exciting day.</p>  <p>Personally I’m looking forward to meet personally some of the guys whose blogs I read on a regular basis. I’m just sad we cannot have Steve Strong presenting the Linq to NHibernate session as announced when we organized the event at first...this ‘forced’ my good fellow <a href="http://www.codewrecks.com">Alkampfer</a> and me to step up and cover the hole.</p>  <p>For more info and constant updates on the event head to: <a href="http://www.nhday.eu/en.aspx">http://www.nhday.eu/en.aspx</a></p>  <p>To follow us on twitter the hashtag is: #nhday</p>  <p>See you there...I’m sure we’ll have a great day together.</p><h2>Related Content</h2><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/breaking-news-european-nhibernate-day-officially-announced">Breaking news: the First European NHibernate Day had been officially announced</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/nhday-event-thoughts">#nhday - after event thoughts</a> (10/11/2010)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/nhibernate-impressions-conform">NHibernate - First impressions on ConfORM</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/nhibernate-customize-linq-provider-user-defined-sql-functions">NHibernate - Customize the Linq provider to call your user defined SQL functions</a> (10/01/2010)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/hands-conform-mixed-mapping-techniques">Hands on ConfORM: mixed mapping techniques</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="/Blog/Related/the-nhibernate-day-is-coming.this-saturday"><strong>More related document (21)</strong></a></li></ul><br />
