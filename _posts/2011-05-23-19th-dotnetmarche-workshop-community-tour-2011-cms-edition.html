title: 19th DotNetMarche Workshop “Community Tour 2011 - CMS Edition”
---

<p>In a few days the 19th <a href="http://www.dotnetmarche.org/">DotNetMarche</a> workshop will take place, this time we will have a sort of multi-track event and we will try to show you some of the features that the major .NET CMS Platforms have to offer: we will tracks on Orchard, Microsoft SharePoint, DotNetNuke and Open Web Studio. </p>  <p>All the tracks will be in Italian language, you know...DotNetMarche is a local user group after all <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.primordialcode.com/UserFiles/Guardian/wlEmoticon-smile_2_2.png" />. We will maybe have support to stream one of the track (once again thanks to the guys at Ce.S.M.I. at the Università Politecnica delle Marche; Giuliano, you rock even with a twisted ankle!), so stay tuned on our twitter accounts and the homepage of the website for any announcement in that direction.</p>  <p>I think this will be a good occasion for all the developer that live in Marche or in the central zones of Italy to get a good overview of some CMS application frameworks, especially if you face them for the first time in your career.</p>  <p>For detailed information about the actual Agenda, the location and all that’s around the event head up to our .Net User Group’s home page: <a href="http://www.dotnetmarche.org">www.dotnetmarche.org</a></p>  <p>Two quick notes about my sessions:</p>  <p><strong>Orchard - overview</strong>: I will show you how I approached this system at first, assuming you have no knowledge at all of what Orchard is and how it work, it will follow the same path I’ve gone through when first started to learn the framework. It will cover basic concepts and usage.</p>  <p><strong>Orchard - customizing layouts</strong>: I’ll help Michele in his development sessions trying to explain the structure of an Orchard theme and how you can start to customize it. Again it will be an introductory session because skinning an Orchard website it’s a pro job, due to the highly flexible nature of the templating engine itself (and our time is limited); if we will receive good feedbacks we maybe can have some more advanced sessions in one of our next workshops.</p>  <p>See you there!</p><h2>Related Content</h2><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/report-slides-from-community-tour-2011-cms-edition">Report & Slides from “Community Tour 2011 - CMS Edition”</a> (06/01/2011)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/tomorrows-dotnetmarche-workshop-live-streaming">Tomorrow’s DotNetMarche Workshop Live Streaming</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/18th-dotnetmarche-workshop-c4-linq-parallel-libraries-and-micro-framework-.net">18th DotNetMarche Workshop: C#4, Linq, Parallel Libraries and Micro Framework .NET</a> (03/09/2011)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/dotnetmarche-january-workshop-wpf-mvvm-ui">DotNetMarche January Workshop - WPF, MVVM, UI</a> (01/12/2010)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/days-sign-12th-dotnetmarche-community-tour-2009-workshop">Last few days to sign up for the 12th DotNetMarche / Community Tour 2009 workshop</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="/Blog/Related/19th-dotnetmarche-workshop-community-tour-2011-cms-edition"><strong>More related document (19)</strong></a></li></ul><br />
