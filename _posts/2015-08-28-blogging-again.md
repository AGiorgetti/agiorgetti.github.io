Time to start blogging again! 
After a couple of years it seems I found my passion again.
So, to start this new adventure - and keep the fun up trying new things, I've migrated my old blog from [Dexter-Blog-Engine](https://github.com/imperugo/Dexter-Blog-Engine)
(a project started by my friend [Ugo Lattanzi](http://tostring.it/), to which I contributed too) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages (yes, I'd like to save some money too!).

The old posts were roughly migrated and the styling can still be not prefect, especially when it comes to the code blocks.
But it's a thing I'll work out over time when I get more familiar with this 'platform' and its way of doing things.

Enough for this very quick comeback, _cya next!_
