title: Are you ready for the upcoming DotNetMarche workshop on July 16 ?
---

<p>This announce will be particularly interesting for the people that live and work Italy: our .Net User Group DotNetMarche organizes another cross community Workshop. </p>  <p>This time we team up with DotDotNet, Gaia srl and Ce.S.M.I. of the University of Ancona (Italy) to offer you a complete overview over the challenges you have to face when designing and building up a Silverlight SOA application: from the relationships with the customers, the design and the UI/UX prototyping, the application lifecycle and the coding stage using various patterns...I know it’s quite an ambitious plan!</p>  <p>For the registration, the complete agenda and the details on the location and speakers take a look at our website: <a href="http://dotnetmarche.org">http://dotnetmarche.org</a></p>  <p>This time, thanks to the guys at Ce.S.M.I, we will also probably be able to offer you the whole workshop using internet streaming too, so if you cannot be physically there you have a chance to follow us anyway! For further details on how to attend the workshop online keep following this blog or our official DotNetMarche website.</p>  <p>See you there!</p><h2>Related Content</h2><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/days-sign-12th-dotnetmarche-community-tour-2009-workshop">Last few days to sign up for the 12th DotNetMarche / Community Tour 2009 workshop</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/getting-ready-for-the-12th-dotnetmarche-workshop-community-tour-2009">Getting ready for the 12th DotNetMarche Workshop “Community Tour 2009”</a> (12/03/2009)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/workshop-silverlight-action-starting-point-line-business-applications">Workshop: ‘Silverlight in Action - a starting point for Line of Business Applications’</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/silverlight-action-december-thursday-11">'Silverlight in Action' on December, Thursday 11</a> (12/01/2008)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/tomorrows-dotnetmarche-workshop-live-streaming">Tomorrow’s DotNetMarche Workshop Live Streaming</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="/Blog/Related/ready-upcoming-dotnetmarche-workshop-july-16"><strong>More related document (49)</strong></a></li></ul><br />
