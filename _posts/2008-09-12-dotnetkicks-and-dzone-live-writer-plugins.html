<p></p>  <p></p>  <p>Beeing a noob blogger as I am, I continously discover something new. Some time ago my friend Alkampfer introduced me to the DotNetKicks world, it’s an aggregator site for those who don’t know used mainly by developers. Recently I discovered DZone which do the same job. Now I use them both regularly to keep trace of what happens around and find interesting articles to read.</p>  <p>But adding the code to link manually both can be boring, so I want to thank John Papa for his great Live Writer plugins that covers both worlds, you can reach his posts on the plugins starting from this link: <a title="http://johnpapa.net/all/dzone-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/" href="http://johnpapa.net/all/dzone-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/">http://johnpapa.net/all/dzone-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/</a></p>  <p>Using the updated versions of those plugin + the new beta of Live Writer both the anchors will be added at the post footer automatically without anything else to do…that’s a lot of time saved.</p>
