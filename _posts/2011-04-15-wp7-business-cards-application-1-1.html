<p>In the next few hours my first WP7 application called ‘Business Cards’ should go live with its version 1.1.</p>  <p>‘Business Cards’ is a digital business cards and contact info classifier application: you can take snapshot, rate, add information and categorize your contacts.</p>  <p>You can have detailed information about this application in its dedicated <a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/wp7-business-cards" target="_blank">support page</a> in this very same blog (under the WP7 section in he main menu).</p>  <p>‘Business Cards’ offers a trial version which is fully featured, ads free and without any limitation nor expiration time, you are not forced to buy the application in any way: you can keep using the trial version if you want.</p>  <p>But sadly we have a problem in the marketplace (which I discovered late) that will prevent the Trial apps to be updated in a clean way: the only way to update a trial app is to uninstall and reinstall the application, which is not good because you will end up loose your data.</p>  <p>Luckily enough I had provided a data backup/restore mechanism in ‘Business Cards’ (which I will also use in my next products) so, before updating, remember to perform a full backup of your data (again you can have detailed information about the procedure in the support page mentioned above).</p>  <p>If you have any problem with this procedure and/or something do not work keep a copy of your data and send me an email (at: <a href="mailto:guardian@nablasoft.com">guardian@nablasoft.com</a>), I’ll check the problem and will find a way to adapt the data to the new format.</p>  <p>I will (slowly) add support pages for all my other active projects and resources over time.</p>  <p>See you all next!</p>
