<p>Sometimes, especially when you have a technical blog and publish code examples or even fully working controls, it can be important to clearly states the License under which you release your work and how others can/should use it.</p>  <p>I always underestimated this point and didnâ€™t spent too much time on it in the past, but recently I started to look around at what types of licenses one can use for the software he produces that he want to share with the community.</p>  <p>Today, after checking some options, I decided to opt for a Creative Common license system (have a look at <a title="http://creativecommons.org/" href="http://creativecommons.org/">http://creativecommons.org/</a>) which also allow distribution and commercial use of the samples I will post here.</p>  <p>If you have a blog and/or post code samples attaching a license to them, will help your readers to use the code the way it was meant to be by the author.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:dc85c686-60a4-4710-adbc-a0cd317be1e8" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Software+License" rel="tag">Software License</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Copyright" rel="tag">Copyright</a></div>  <p>&#160;</p><h2>Related Content</h2><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/code-analysis-refactoring-utilities">Some Code Analysis and Refactoring Utilities you may like</a> (11/03/2008)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="/Blog/Related/importance-license"><strong>More related document (1)</strong></a></li></ul><br />
