title: Internet Explorer 8 causes troubles to Vista and TestDriven.Net (‘test with...debugger’
  not working)
---

<p>Two days ago I installed Internet Explorer 8 and I have to admit I was quite satisfied by its performance... it seemed more responsive and with faster load times compared to Ie7.</p>  <p>However today I started to experience the first problems...in Windows Vista (I have an Italian version of the operating system) I noticed that each time I opened a new folder on the file system, it would open in a new window, totally ignoring the option to open it in the same window (I’ve double checked both the option and the registry keys to make sure the settings were correct).</p>  <p>The second strange thing was the fact that TestDriven.Net option ‘Test with...debugger’ stopped working. I’ve spent 2 hours messing with the registry keys and similar trying to figure out the problem without success.</p>  <p>The last option I had was to check for whatever I’ve installed in the last days and guess what? After removing Ie8 and restarting everything started to work again.</p>  <p>To uninstall Internet Explorer 8, go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and click on <strong>Uninstall Programs</strong> link or <strong>Programs and Features</strong> icon. Then on Tasks pane on the left, click on <strong>View installed updates</strong> link. Locate and select <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong>. </p>  <p>I’ll install it again (in a virtual machine this time) and try to investigate the problem more when I have time.</p>  <p>Update:</p>  <p>I tried to install it again to see if some updates solved the issue, but once again I had no luck. I decided to spent some time again looking for a solution and I saw that many guys around had the same issue and resolved it just launching IE8 with Administrative privileges. It obviously did not work for me :).</p>  <p>Then I found some posts of people that propose registry hacks, I tried them with no luck until I found this post on eggheadcafe: <a title="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/conversation.aspx?messageid=34297087&amp;threadid=32958968" href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/conversation.aspx?messageid=34297087&amp;threadid=32958968">http://www.eggheadcafe.com/conversation.aspx?messageid=34297087&amp;threadid=32958968</a></p>  <blockquote>   <pre>*  open a new &quot;Command Prompt&quot; window by right-clicking and selecting &quot;Run
as administrator&quot;;
*  at the prompt, run the command &quot;regsvr32 actxprxy.dll&quot;.</pre>

<p>registering this DLL solved all the problems for me.</p>
