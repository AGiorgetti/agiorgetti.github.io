Recently, together with <a href="http://lacorrente.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Diego Guidi</a>, <a href="http://www.rainbowbreeze.it/" target="_blank">Alfredo Morresi</a> and <a href="http://www.nablasoft.com/alkampfer" target="_blank">Gian Maria Ricci</a>, I was the speaker in the 11th workshop presented by our .net user group <a href="http://www.dotnetmarche.org" target="_blank">DotNetMarche</a>.<br /><br />We talked about solution refactoring presenting some guidelines and why/how you should do refactoring (Alfredo Morresi); then we had a session in which we presented some advances features of Resharper, one of the tool we use to help us during the refactoring activities (Diego Guidi).<br /><br />The 3rd session (held by the proud owner of this blog :)) was about refactoring ASP.NET pages and controls, showing how you can refactor a completely non structured and fully hardcoded solution to reach an MVC approach, while improving the general performances of the pages/controls at the same time.<br /><br />The last session (Gian Maria Ricci) was devoted to ASP.NET pages refactoring, showing you how the refactoring activity of a page or control in different components can facilitate the testing of each piece of the application.<br /><br />If you are interested, the material of the workshop is available following this link: <a href="http://dotnetmarche.org/files/folders/11_-_refactoring_2themax_09102009/default.aspx" target="_blank">http://dotnetmarche.org/files/folders/11_-_refactoring_2themax_09102009/default.aspx</a>

The website of the user group is in Italian (cause we are a local community), but the slides and the source code presented are written in English.<h2>Related Content</h2><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/tomorrows-dotnetmarche-workshop-live-streaming">Tomorrow’s DotNetMarche Workshop Live Streaming</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/18th-dotnetmarche-workshop-c4-linq-parallel-libraries-and-micro-framework-.net">18th DotNetMarche Workshop: C#4, Linq, Parallel Libraries and Micro Framework .NET</a> (03/09/2011)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/dotnetmarche-january-workshop-wpf-mvvm-ui">DotNetMarche January Workshop - WPF, MVVM, UI</a> (01/12/2010)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/days-sign-12th-dotnetmarche-community-tour-2009-workshop">Last few days to sign up for the 12th DotNetMarche / Community Tour 2009 workshop</a> (26/08/2015)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/getting-ready-for-the-12th-dotnetmarche-workshop-community-tour-2009">Getting ready for the 12th DotNetMarche Workshop “Community Tour 2009”</a> (12/03/2009)</li><li style="list-style-type: none"><a href="/Blog/Related/dotnetmarche-workshop-material-refactoring-2-the-max"><strong>More related document (9)</strong></a></li></ul><br />
