<p>I’ll make this short post to test the new Windows Live Writer (which seems quite cool at a first look).</p>  <p>Yesterday I got some good news, I passed both the certification exams I tried some time ago:</p>  <ul>   <li>071-518 - Pro: Design &amp; Develop Windows Apps Using MS .NET Framework 4 </li>    <li>071-519 - Pro: Designing &amp; Developing Web Apps Using MS .NET Framework 4 </li> </ul>  <p>Maybe I’ll try some more of them now :).</p>
