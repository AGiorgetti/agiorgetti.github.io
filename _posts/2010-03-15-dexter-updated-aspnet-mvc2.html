title: Dexter has been updated to Asp.NET MVC2
---

<p>
	Due to the recent release of Asp.NET MVC2 we&rsquo;ve decided to port Dexter to the new engine; Ugo spent a couple of days reorganizing the repository and doing the porting (you can read more info on his Italian blog: <a href="http://www.tostring.it" target="_blank">http://www.tostring.it</a>).</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;ve just fixed some of the bugs that arose after the porting...one them will require some further investigation and will be the subject for a next post :)</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;re interested in giving a look to the project go to our Codeplex page (<a href="http://dexterblogengine.codeplex.com/">http://dexterblogengine.codeplex.com/</a>), I recommend you to perform a fresh checkout to a new directory because many things were relocated.</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;ve switched the developing environment to Visual Studio 2010, if you have troubles in installing Asp.NET MVC2 in your developing machine, you can follow the guideline given in this post: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/shijuvarghese/archive/2010/03/12/installing-asp-net-mvc-2-rtm-on-visual-studio-2010-rc.aspx" target="_blank">Installing ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM on Visual Studio 2010 RC</a>.</p>
<p>
	To see the new version of Dexter in action you don&rsquo;t have to go too far: this blog (and Ugo&rsquo;s blog too) now runs with the current Trunk version with supports MVC2!</p>
