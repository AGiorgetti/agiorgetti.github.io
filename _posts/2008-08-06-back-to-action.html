From time to time I really think that I should start to blog things seriously, but I have to admitt I'm just to lazy to do things properly.<br /><br />This will be a new start for me and I really hope to carry the whole thing on, so from now on less playing with World of Warcraft and more software developing (maybe).<br /><br />Due to my 'not so good' english many articles and posts will be subject to continous revisions...cause I really dislike to make mistakes :D.
